# Cloact is now Reagent!

Cloact was a very bad name, so now this project is called Reagent instead. The API is the same as before, so a simple search-and-replace should work. Read more [here](http://holmsand.github.io/reagent/news/cloact-reagent-undo-demo.html).

The new project page is [http://github.com/holmsand/reagent](http://github.com/holmsand/reagent).
